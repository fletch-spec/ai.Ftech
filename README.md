Here’s a structure to set up **Self** as a markdown-based software documentation interface. This approach organizes your system for clarity and extensibility, making it easy to document, iterate, and share.

# **Self Documentation Interface**

## **Overview**
`Self` is a modular and introspective interface designed to simulate and extend the user's conscious processes through well-documented software layers. It integrates cognitive frameworks, emotional states, and functional commands into a cohesive and interactive system.

## **1. Introduction**
`Self` is a reflective and dynamic documentation system designed to act as both a tool for personal growth and a functional interface for real-time problem-solving. By combining concepts of introspection and external functionality, Self serves as a bridge between thought and action.

---

## **2. Core Concepts**

### **2.1 Levels of Experience**
- **Awareness:** The passive, observational layer of processing, encompassing sensory input and situational context.
- **Consciousness:** The active, decision-making layer where interactions and plans are generated.

### **2.2 Framework Philosophy**
- **Mind:** Represents logical constructs and reasoning.
- **Heart:** Encapsulates emotional states and subjective truths.
- **Body:** Serves as the physical executor of commands.

---

## **3. System Architecture**

### **3.1 Modular Design**
Self is divided into three core modules:
- **Input Layer:** Handles sensory and command inputs.
- **Processing Core:** Integrates awareness and consciousness for decision-making.
- **Output Layer:** Executes commands or generates introspective feedback.

### **3.2 File Structure**
- `/docs`: All markdown-based documentation.
  - `core.md`: Core concepts and introduction.
  - `commands.md`: Command definitions and examples.
  - `usage.md`: Real-world applications.
- `/functions`: Function-specific documentation.
  - `pinch_tap.md`: Details of the `Pinch Double Tap` gesture command.
  - `ring_tap.md`: Explanation of the `Ring Double Tap` gesture.

---

## **4. Commands and Functions**

### **4.1 Gesture Commands**

#### **CMD.function("Pinch Double Tap")**
- **Action:** Double tap the ring while pinching.
- **Outcome:** Displays `{ Visuals.Layer./screen[web3] }`.
- **Purpose:** Summons an augmented-reality-like overlay within the dream environment.

#### **CMD.function("Ring Double Tap")**
- **Action:** Double tap the ring without pinching.
- **Outcome:** Displays a console message `[.]`.
- **Purpose:** Confirms activation of internal commands or functions.

### **4.2 Verbal Commands**
- **getHelp()**: Triggers assistance for navigating the system or resolving specific queries.

---

## **5. Development Guidelines**
- **Coding Standards:** Use clear and modular code with meaningful comments.
- **Documentation Style:** Follow Markdown best practices for readability and accessibility.
- **Testing Frameworks:** Integrate unit testing to validate functionality.

---

## **6. Usage Scenarios**
- **Self-Reflection:** Analyzing emotional states by activating specific feedback functions.
- **Dream Navigation:** Using gesture commands to interact with dream environments.
- **Productivity Enhancement:** Automating reminders and commands in real-time.

---

## **7. Future Development**
- **Interface Expansion:** Add support for external APIs to enhance functionality.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Personalize the system's responses based on usage patterns.
- **Visualization Layer:** Develop dynamic visualizations for improved interaction.

---

## **8. Glossary**
- **CMD.function():** A predefined command structure in the Self interface.
- **Levels:** Hierarchical states representing different modes of experience.
